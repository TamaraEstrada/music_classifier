## 1. Key Concepts

### 1.1 Audio Signal Processing
Audio files are digital representations of sound waves. When we work with audio:
- Sound waves are converted into digital signals through sampling
- The sampling rate (e.g., 22050 Hz) tells us how many times per second we measure the wave
- These measurements create a time series of amplitude values

### 1.2 Feature Extraction (MFCC)
Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) are the key features we extract from audio:
- They represent the short-term power spectrum of sound
- They approximate how human ears process sound
- They're particularly good at capturing timbre and tone characteristics
- MFCCs are calculated in several steps:
  1. Divide the signal into short frames
  2. Apply Fourier transform to get the frequency spectrum
  3. Map frequencies to Mel scale (how humans perceive pitch)
  4. Take the logarithm of the powers
  5. Apply Discrete Cosine Transform

### 1.3 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
KNN is our classification algorithm:
- It's a simple but effective method for classification
- It works by finding the K closest examples in the training data
- The class is determined by majority vote among these neighbors
- Distance metrics determine what "closest" means

## 2. Code Breakdown

### 2.1 Feature Extractor (feature_extractor.py)

```python
class FeatureExtractor:
    def __init__(self, data_directory):
        self.directory = data_directory
```
- Creates a class to handle feature extraction
- Takes the directory path where audio files are stored

```python
    def extract_features(self, output_file="dataset.dat"):
        with open(output_file, "wb") as f:
```
- Opens a binary file to store extracted features
- 'wb' mode means write binary

```python
            for i, folder in enumerate(os.listdir(self.directory), 1):
                if i == 11:  # We have 10 genres
                    break
```
- Iterates through genre folders
- Starts counting from 1 (enumerate with start=1)
- Stops after 10 genres

```python
                for file in os.listdir(folder_path):
                    try:
                        rate, sig = wav.read(file_path)
```
- `rate`: sampling rate (how many measurements per second)
- `sig`: actual audio signal (array of amplitude values)

```python
                        mfcc_feat = mfcc(sig, rate, winlen=0.020, appendEnergy=False)
```
- Extracts MFCC features from the signal
- `winlen=0.020`: uses 20ms windows (standard in audio processing)
- Returns matrix where each row is a frame and each column is an MFCC coefficient

```python
                        covariance = np.cov(np.matrix.transpose(mfcc_feat))
                        mean_matrix = mfcc_feat.mean(0)
```
- Calculates statistical features from MFCCs:
  - Covariance matrix: captures relationships between coefficients
  - Mean matrix: average values of coefficients
- These summarize the entire audio file's characteristics

```python
                        feature = (mean_matrix, covariance, i)
                        pickle.dump(feature, f)
```
- Creates feature tuple: (mean, covariance, genre_label)
- Saves to binary file using pickle

### 2.2 KNN Classifier (model.py)

```python
class KNNClassifier:
    def __init__(self, k=5):
        self.k = k
        self.training_set = []
        self.test_set = []
```
- Initializes classifier with k=5 neighbors
- Creates empty lists for training and test data

```python
    def distance(self, instance1, instance2):
        mm1, cm1 = instance1[0], instance1[1]  # mean and covariance of first instance
        mm2, cm2 = instance2[0], instance2[1]  # mean and covariance of second instance
```
- Extracts statistical features from both instances

```python
        distance = np.trace(np.dot(np.linalg.inv(cm2), cm1))
        distance += np.dot(np.dot((mm2-mm1).transpose(), np.linalg.inv(cm2)), mm2-mm1)
        distance += np.log(np.linalg.det(cm2)) - np.log(np.linalg.det(cm1))
```
- Calculates distance using a specialized metric for multivariate normal distributions
- This is more sophisticated than Euclidean distance
- Better suited for comparing audio feature distributions

```python
    def get_neighbors(self, training_set, instance):
        distances = []
        for x in range(len(training_set)):
            dist = self.distance(training_set[x], instance)
```
- Calculates distance to every training example
- Creates list of (label, distance) pairs

```python
        distances.sort(key=operator.itemgetter(1))
        neighbors = [distances[x][0] for x in range(self.k)]
```
- Sorts by distance
- Takes k closest neighbors

```python
    def nearest_class(self, neighbors):
        class_votes = {}
        for response in neighbors:
            class_votes[response] = class_votes.get(response, 0) + 1
```
- Counts votes for each class among neighbors
- Uses dictionary to track counts

```python
    def load_dataset(self, filename, split=0.68):
        dataset = []
        with open(filename, 'rb') as f:
            while True:
                try:
                    dataset.append(pickle.load(f))
                except EOFError:
                    break
```
- Loads features from binary file
- Continues until end of file (EOFError)

```python
        for x in dataset:
            if random.random() < split:
                self.training_set.append(x)
            else:
                self.test_set.append(x)
```
- Randomly splits data into training (68%) and test (32%) sets
- Uses random number generator for splitting

### 2.3 Prediction Pipeline

When classifying a new audio file:
1. Load and read WAV file
2. Extract MFCC features
3. Calculate statistical features (mean and covariance)
4. Find k nearest neighbors in training set
5. Take majority vote to determine genre

## 3. Understanding the Results

Your model achieved 73.35% accuracy, which means:
- It correctly classified about 234 out of 319 test samples
- This is good for a 10-class problem (random guessing would be 10%)
- Common errors might include:
  - Confusion between similar genres (e.g., rock vs metal)
  - Songs that blend multiple genres
  - Audio quality variations

## 4. Possible Improvements

1. Feature Engineering:
   - Add more audio features (spectral centroid, zero crossing rate)
   - Use different window sizes for MFCC extraction
   - Apply feature normalization

2. Model Improvements:
   - Try different k values
   - Use weighted voting based on distance
   - Implement feature selection

3. Data Processing:
   - Handle class imbalance
   - Augment data with pitch shifting
   - Use cross-validation instead of single train-test split
